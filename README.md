# Telecom-Management-System (student project)
The GUI based application stores records of users and employees and performs the functions such as ‘Add’, ‘Search’, ‘Modify’ &amp; ‘Delete’. 

It was a great learning process while creating this project during 2nd year when the core CS subjects were introduced.    

Domain: Desktop application development;

Programming language: Java; 

IDE: Netbeans;

'Search' function may not work properly. 

More features are being worked upon as I learn more stuff.
